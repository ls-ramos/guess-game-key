# Guess game key

Have fun with friends trying to hack each other's password !

## Goal
The goal of this project was to try out the development of a multiplayer game. It was my first project released in play store :) !

## What i would change if i would spend more time on this project
As i did that project in the beginning of my life as a programmer it is not so well structured and there is no unit or interfase test on it, so if i would keep updating this project that would be the first steps, create a better object oriented structure and add unit tests as well as interfase tests.

## Publish
